                    Hello, my name is <strong>Robert Khachaturovi</strong>, a 15-year-old web developer from Tbilisi,
                    Georgia.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I fell in love with programming a few years ago, and since then I've been growing in this field
                    every single day. I'm very determined and approach everything with great enthusiasm — especially
                    when it comes to modern technologies, logical challenges, or creating interesting projects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I learn very quickly — new languages, frameworks, and technologies come naturally to me because I
                    enjoy experimenting, practicing, and constantly improving myself. I focus on writing clean code,
                    paying attention to visual details, and delivering a polished UI/UX experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Currently, I am actively involved in frontend development, but in the future, I want to learn much
                    more — backend development, deeper knowledge of JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, as well as
                    design-related skills. My goal is to become a professional full-stack developer and build projects
                    that deliver real value.
                </p>

                <p class="closing-paragraph">
                    For me, continuous growth is essential — keeping up with modern technologies and always expanding my
                    skillset.
